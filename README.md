# AI Maths

A repository to hold all the maths concepts and formulas that I learned or is going to learn in my AI journey.

## What can you expect

It will cover everything, from the most basic to most advanced math concepts required for AI stuff. The initial stages will not include things related to AI.
But basic concepts of maths that will be required in the future stages.

So if you are interested follow this repo. And i will try my best to post something every week.

I wont be accepting any PR's, but you can create issues If I made any mistakes.

All the code that might be here will be written in Python3.9 or above or in some cases( way too rare ) in rust.
